# Next.js with TypeScript Starter includeing Material UI.

## How to use

Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/rabius-sunny/nextJs-typescript-Mui-starter):


```sh
git clone https://github.com/rabius-sunny/nextJs-typescript-Mui-starter.git
cd nextJs-typescript-Mui-starter
```

Install it and run:

```sh
yarn
yarn run dev
```

or:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@material-ui/core` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in Material-UI v5. If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://next.material-ui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## The link component

Next.js has [a custom Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).
The example folder provides adapters for usage with Material-UI.
More information [in the documentation](https://next.material-ui.com/guides/routing/#next-js).

## What's next?

You now have a working example project.
You can head back to the documentation, continuing browsing it from the [templates](https://next.material-ui.com/getting-started/templates/) section.
